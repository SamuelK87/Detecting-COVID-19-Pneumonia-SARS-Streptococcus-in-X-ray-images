Detecting COVID-19, Pneumonia, SARS, Streptococcus  in X-ray images with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning


COVID-19 tests are currently hard to come by — there are simply not enough of them and they cannot be manufactured fast enough, which is causing panic.Given that there are limited COVID-19 testing kits, we need to rely on other diagnosis measures.

Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyze the health of a patient’s lungs.And given that nearly all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, it could be possible to use X-rays to test for COVID-19 without the dedicated test kits.

A drawback is that X-ray analysis requires a radiology expert and takes significant time — which is precious when people are sick around the world. Therefore developing an automated analysis system is required to save medical professionals valuable time.
